This project focuses on scraping data from the Redbus website using Selenium, storing the collected information in a MySQL database, and presenting it through a Streamlit application. The data scraping process is carried out in a Jupyter Notebook[.ipynb file], with database interactions managed using MySQL[.ipynb file]. The data visualization and user interface are developed in Visual Studio Code [.py file].

Requirements:  Jupyter Notebook, MySQL Server, Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome (browser), Selenium WebDriver for Chrome, and Streamlit.

Additionally, I have included an illustration of the Redbus project in the main file for a more detailed explanation.
